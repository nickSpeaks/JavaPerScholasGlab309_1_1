# Guided Lab - 309.2.1 - SP1
How to Use the Spring Initializr to set up a Spring Boot Project

## Lab Objective: 
Spring Initializr is an online tool you can use to generate Spring Starter projects. The tool allows you to download the project and open it in your local IDE.

This lab will explain how to configure the Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr â€” step-by-step. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a Spring Boot web application:

### What You Need
* A favorite text editor or IDE.
* JDK 1.8 or later.
* Maven 3.2+.

### You can also import the code straight into your IDE:
* Eclipse or IntelliJ IDE.

## Development Steps
To initialize the project:
- Navigate to https://start.spring.io. This service pulls in all of the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
- Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.
- Click Dependencies and select Spring Web.
- Click Generate.
- Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.
